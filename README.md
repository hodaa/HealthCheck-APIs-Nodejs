## Montior  Api

## Architecture

* If you want  to add a new Data provider you can go to
  `app/DataProvider/` and add new class extends HotelDataMapper class  and map name from your provider to system names.
  

  

## Design Pattern Used

1- `Abstract Factory` pattern to encapsulate creation of the data provider object  from the business logic

2- `Reposiotory` pattern  to get data form datasource (Apis).

3- `Service` pattern I added all business logic in separate classes.
